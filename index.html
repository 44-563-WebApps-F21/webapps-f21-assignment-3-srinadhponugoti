    <h3>Breadth-first search (BFS)</h3>
    <p>
    <blockquote>
        It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the
        next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were
        encountered but not yet explored.In contrast,  depth-first search, which explores the node branch as far
        as possible before backtracking and expanding other nodes may get lost in an infinite branch and never make
        it to the solution node. Iterative deepening depth-first search avoids the latter drawback at the price of
        exploring the tree's top parts over and over again. On the other hand, both depth-first algorithms get along
        without extra memory.
        <br>
        Breadth-first search can be generalized to graphs, when the start node sometimes referred to as a 'search
        key is explicitly given, and precautions are taken against following a vertex twice.
        <br>
        BFS and its application in finding connected components of graphs were invented in 1945 by Konrad Zuse, in his
        (rejected) Ph.D. thesis on the Plankalk√ºl programming language, but this was not published until 1972.[4] It was
        reinvented in 1959 by Edward F. Moore, who used it to find the shortest path out of a maze and later
        developed by C. Y. Lee into a wire routing algorithm .
